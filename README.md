# meal-project

-Using React Framework ,developed a web application that utilizes a MEAL DB API to load and present a variety of meal data. The application features components for viewing mixed dishes, selecting filtered dishes from the API.
The application offers additional features, such as routing, convenient page pagination, "Add to Cart" functionality, and informative popups that provide detailed descriptions of the clicked items.
These enhancements contribute to an enhanced user experience, making the process of browsing, selecting, and learning more about the available meals easy and delightful.
